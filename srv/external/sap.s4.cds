   * When incoming invoices are entered or when memos are entered in Financial Accounting (FI), the system checks whether an invoice or credit memo has already been entered for the same date.

For this, the system checks invoices that have been held or parked or that contain errors, or invoices that were entered for invoice verification in the background. The check is performed only if you specify the reference document number when you enter the invoices. When checking for duplicate invoices, the system compares the following specified characteristics: Vendor Currency Company Code Gross Invoice Amount Reference Document Number Invoice Document Date If all of these characteristics are the same, the system issues a message for which you can change the message type in Customizing. When you enter credit memos or subsequent adjustments, the system does not check for duplicate invoices. Exception: For Argentina, invoices and credit memos are checked for duplicates. No message is issued if you enter a document that has previously been reversed. In Customizing for Logistics Invoice Verification under Incoming Invoice -> Set Check for Duplicate Invoices, you can specify that the following characteristics are not checked: Reference Document Number Invoice Document Date Company Code Having fewer attributes to check increases the likelihood that the system will find a duplicate invoice. Example: The following document has already been entered and posted: Reference Document Number 333 Invoice Date: 4/28/2000 Gross Invoice Amount 100.00 Currency: EUR Vendor: Spencer Company Code: Chicago You have set up the check for duplicate invoices as follows in Customizing: The characteristics Reference Document Number and Company Code are not activated. Consequently, these characteristics are not checked. Now you enter the following invoice: Reference Document Number 334 Invoice Date: 4/28/2000 Gross Invoice Amount 100.00 Currency: EUR Vendor: Spencer Company Code: Flagstaff Result Because you entered a reference document when you entered the invoice, the system checks for duplicate invoices. Compared against the invoice entered earlier, the invoice just entered has different values in the characteristics Reference and Company Code. However, these characteristics are not checked due to the settings that you have made in Customizing. All other characteristics are the same. The system issues a message telling you that an invoice has been entered twice. If the characteristic &quot;Reference Document Number&quot; had been selected in Customizing, the system would have checked the reference document number and established that it was different from the invoice entered earlier, and it consequently would not have issued a message. Checking FI Documents The system checks whether there are FI documents that were posted or parked with the Logistics invoice verification or with an FI invoice transaction. Depending on the entry in the Reference field, one of the following checks is performed: If a reference number was specified in the sequential invoice/credit memo, the system checks whether an invoice/credit memo has already been posted for which all the following attributes agree: Company Code Vendor Currency Document Date Reference Number If no reference number was specified in the sequential invoice/credit memo, the system checks whether an invoice/credit memo has already been posted for which all the following attributes agree: Company Code Vendor Currency Document Date Amount in Document Currency In Materials Management, the system applies the check for duplicate invoices for invoices only, not for credit memos.

   * General shipping strategy for the delivery of goods from the vendor to the customer. You can define shipping conditions in your system which correspond to the requirements of your company. You can specify a shipping condition in the customer master and in the vendor master. Shipping point determination (outbound delivery): The loading group, the plant and the shipping condition determine the shipping point that will be proposed by the system. Route determination (outbound delivery): Apart from the country and the geographical region of the shipping point, the ship-to party and the transportation group, the shipping condition determines the route that the system proposes in the order for the delivery of the goods. In the delivery, the route proposal also takes the weight group into account. A particular customer always requires immediate delivery. You enter the appropriate shipping condition into the customer master record. This means that when you process orders for this customer, the system automatically proposes the express mail room as a shipping point and the quickest way to the airport as a route. If a shipping condition has been assigned to a sales document type in Customizing, this condition will be proposed by the system in the corresponding sales document. If there is no assignment, the system copies the relevant data from the corresponding customer master record of the sold-to party. You cannot change this value during delivery processing. The shipping condition will not be copied from the delivery into the shipment. The shipping condition is one of several criteria for selecting deliveries when you create a shipment. You can enter a shipping condition manually in the shipment where it only serves as a characteristic for grouping shipments.
