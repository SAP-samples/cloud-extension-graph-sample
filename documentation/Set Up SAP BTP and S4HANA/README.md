# Set Up Connectivity and Extensibility

To build extension applications for your SAP S/4HANA Cloud system, you need to connect your SAP S/4HANA Cloud system to your SAP BTP global account.

## Register Your SAP S/4HANA Cloud System

To be able to do register your SAP S/4HANA Cloud system in your SAP BTP cockpit, in respect to authorizations, you must be:
- An administrator of the SAP BTP global account
- An administrator of the SAP S/4HANA Cloud system

### Acquire an SAP BTP Integration Token for Registration

1. In your [SAP BTP Cockpit](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/), open your global account.

2. In your global account, navigate to **System Landscape** &rarr; **Add System** in the left-hand pane.

3. In the **Add System** popup, enter the **System Name** for the SAP S/4HANA Cloud system you want to connect.

- Recommendation: Use a name that uniquely identifies this system.

 ![Register System](./images/setup1.png)

4. In the dropdown list for **Type**, choose `SAP S/4HANA Cloud`.

5. Choose **Register**.

SAP BTP generates an integration token so the SAP S/4HANA Cloud system administrator can configure integration with the SAP BTP from your SAP S/4HANA Cloud system.

 ![Choose Register](./images/setup2.png)

6. Copy the generated token and close the dialog box.

 ![Token](./images/setup3.png)

### Add Integration Token to SAP S/4HANA Cloud System

1. Log in to your SAP S/4HANA Cloud tenant.

2. Navigate from **Home** to **Communication Management** tab and choose the tile **Maintain Extensions on SAP BTP**.

 ![Maintain](./images/setup4.png)

3. On **Maintain Extensions on SAP BTP** screen in the **Extensions** section, choose **New**.

 ![New](./images/setup5.png)

4. In the **Integration Token** field, paste in the integration token generated and copied from SAP BTP (see previous steps 5 and 6).

 ![Paste](./images/setup6.png)

5. Enter a **Description** for your system integration token.

- Recommendation: Use the same name you entered in SAP BTP when you generated the token in the previous step.

6. Choose **Save**.

- A new entry is displayed for your system in the table with the status *Enabling*.
- Wait for a few seconds.
- After the automated integration, the status of your system integration changes to *Enabled*.
- The same takes place on the SAP BTP side. Wait until the status displayed for your newly registered system switches to **Registered** â€“ potentially you need to refresh your page.


## Set Up Entitlements for Your SAP BTP Subaccount

After you have connected the SAP S/4HANA Cloud system (with status **Enabled** in your SAP S/4HANA Cloud tenant) to the SAP BTP, you need to configure entitlements to make this system accessible in the SAP BTP subaccount in which you want to build your extension application.

In the next steps, you will configure the entitlements and assign the corresponding quota and service plans to the subaccount in which the extension application will reside.

> As a prerequisite both a subaccount with Cloud Foundry enabled and a space need to have been created.

In case that you do not have a subaccount for SAP BTP in place you have to follow these steps:

1. In [SAP BTP Cockpit](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/), open your global account.

2. Create a Subaccount.

3. Enable Cloud Foundry for your new subaccount.

4. Create a Spac in your new subaccount.

See sections [Create a Subaccount](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/05280a123d3044ae97457a25b3013918.html?q=subaccount) and [Create Spaces](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/2f6ed22ccf424dae84345f4500c2d8ea.html) the  BTP documentation for more details.

   > You can freely choose the instance name. You would have to do a few changes in the provided code later on, so for simplicity it is recommended to stick to `georelmessaging` as this is the name we use in the code.

 ![Plan](./images/setup17.png)

5. Choose **Next**.

6. In the **Specify Parameters** dialog box, use the following template, which should have been prefilled for you.
